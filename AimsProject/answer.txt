Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: No. 
While it is possible to have multiple constructors with the same name in a Java class, it is important to note that they cannot have the same parameter data type. 
In this case, since both "title" and "category" have the initial data type of String, it is not possible to create constructors with the same name that take in parameters of the same data type.
