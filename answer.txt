--Even after we swap the objects "jungleDVD" and "cinderellaDVD" 
using the "swap" function, their titles remain the same because 
the "swap" function creates new copies of these objects, and the 
swap occurs between these new references only, while the original 
objects remain unchanged.

-- In the "changeTitle" function, the title of the "jungleDVD" 
changes, as the function creates a copy of "jungleDVD" called 
"jungleDVD_new" that points to the same object. Then the "setTitle"
 method of "jungleDVD_new" is used to update the title, which changes 
 the title of the object that both "jungleDVD_new" and "jungleDVD" were 
 pointing to.
